## The Question That Started This

One day I was browsing the web and a question hit me:

> *"Why can millions of people around the world access the same website 
> at the same moment?"*

The answer isn't the cloud. It's not satellites.  
It's **691 physical cables** lying on the ocean floor — and most people 
have never heard of them.

So I decided to map all of them.

## What I Built

An interactive intelligence dashboard that answers 4 questions 
no one is asking — but everyone should be:

| Question | Key Finding |
|----------|-------------|
| Who controls the ocean floor? | Google owns 34 cables — more than Meta & Amazon combined |
| Where are the weakest points? | 33 nodes that could disconnect entire regions if they fail |
| How exposed is Vietnam? | 3 landing points. Vung Tau handles 50% alone. |
| How fast is this growing? | From 0 to 596 active cables in 30 years |

## Tech Stack & Workflow
```
Chrome DevTools (F12)
        ↓
    Extract 3 JSON files from submarinecablemap.com API
        ↓
    Python + Pandas — parse, clean, engineer features
        ↓
    7 CSV files (691 cables · 1,908 landing points · 186 countries)
        ↓
    Tableau Public — interactive dashboard
```

### Tools Used
- **Data Collection**: Chrome DevTools Network tab → JSON extraction
- **Data Processing**: Python 3.14, Pandas, Requests
- **Visualization**: Tableau Public
- **Environment**: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

Self-collected via Chrome DevTools — no Kaggle, no pre-built datasets.

| File | Rows | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `cables.csv` | 691 | Cable metadata: name, owners, year, length |
| `cable_landingpoint_bridge.csv` | 3,157 | Cable ↔ landing point relationships |
| `landing_points_summary.csv` | 1,908 | Global landing points with cable counts |
| `country_risk.csv` | 186 | Redundancy score per country |
| `bigtech_ownership.csv` | 5 | Big Tech cable ownership breakdown |
| `spof_global.csv` | 33 | Single Point of Failure nodes |
| `vietnam_lp_risk.csv` | 3 | Vietnam landing point risk analysis |

## Key Insights

**🌐 Global Infrastructure**
- 99% of international internet traffic travels through submarine cables
- Batam, Indonesia is the #1 landing point globally with 20 cables
- 24 countries have only 1 cable — zero redundancy

**💰 Big Tech Ocean Control**
- Google: 34 cables (4.9% of global total)
- China Telecom/Mobile/Unicom: 27 cables, averaging 10,615 km each
- Amazon: only 1 active cable today — but 4 more under construction

**⚠️ Infrastructure Risk**
- 33 critical nodes identified as Single Points of Failure
- Batam failure = ~40% of Southeast Asia connectivity lost
- Marseille, Mumbai, and Singapore each carry 16 cables

**🇻🇳 Vietnam Analysis**
- Only 3 landing points for 97 million people
- Vung Tau handles 50% of all cable capacity
- 2 of 8 cables still under construction (2027)
- Vietnam's landing points carry 3x fewer cables than SEA average

## Data Challenges (Interview-Ready Stories)

1. **API endpoint changed** — `cable.json` returned empty response. 
   Solved by inspecting Network tab and discovering `all.json` endpoint.

2. **Owners data not normalized** — same company listed as 
   "Google LLC", "Google", "Alphabet". Built regex mapping to standardize.

3. **691 individual API calls** — fetched detail for each cable separately 
   with rate limiting (0.2s delay) to avoid server blocks.

4. **LineString geometry** — cable route coordinates not usable directly 
   in Tableau. Used landing point coordinates instead.

**I asked a simple question one day:**

*"Why can millions of people around the world access the same website at the same moment?"*

The answer surprised me.

It's not the cloud ☁️  
It's not satellites 🛰️  
It's **691 physical cables** lying on the ocean floor.

So I spent 2 weeks mapping all of them — and what I found was fascinating:

**🔵 Who controls the internet's backbone?**
→ Google owns 34 submarine cables — more than Meta and Amazon *combined*
→ China operates 27 cables averaging 10,615 km each — the longest routes on earth
→ Amazon has only 1 active cable today — but 4 more are under construction

**🔴 The vulnerabilities no one talks about:**
→ 33 "Single Points of Failure" identified globally
→ Batam, Indonesia carries 20 cables — if it goes down, Southeast Asia loses ~40% connectivity
→ 24 countries have exactly 1 cable. No backup. One cut = total blackout.

**🇻🇳 Vietnam's position:**
→ 97 million people. 3 landing points.
→ Vung Tau alone handles 50% of all cable capacity
→ Vietnam's infrastructure is 3x below the Southeast Asian average

**The workflow:**
Chrome DevTools → Python/Pandas → Tableau Public
691 cables · 1,908 landing points · 186 countries

All data self-collected via API — no Kaggle datasets.
